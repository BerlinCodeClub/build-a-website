# Git

## What is it?

- Git is a distributed version control system
- Similar software exists however git is by far the most popular
- Stores files of any type - code, text files, photos of cats - anything!
- Tracks file history - add, edit, delete
- Really good at merging different versions of files

## Branching

- All repos start with a `master` branch by default
- New branches are "branched" from existing branches
- Branches allow different versions of the repository to remain independent
- Branches can be combined by "merging"
